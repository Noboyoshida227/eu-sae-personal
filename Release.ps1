#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Build one release of the EU SAE Application Package - and refuse to build
    one that could not be reproduced or told apart later.

.DESCRIPTION
    Creates  dist\<RELEASE_NAME>\  containing the complete package
    folder, the distributable ZIP, its SHA-256, a RELEASE_INFO.txt that names
    the exact git commit, and the builder's own re-extraction check.

    Before building, it checks four things and stops if any fails:

      1. The working tree is clean (everything committed). A release built
         from uncommitted files matches no commit on GitHub and cannot be
         rebuilt. Use -AllowDirty only for a private test build; it is
         labelled as such and must not be distributed.
      2. dist\<RELEASE_NAME>\ does not already exist. One version is
         built once. To build again, change the version
         (python tools\bump_version.py <new>) or remove that folder if it was
         never sent to anyone.
      3. docs\CHANGELOG.md has a "## <version>" heading, so what changed is
         written down where recipients will find it.
      4. The Spain example data and every other inventory file is present.

    The full process is described in docs\RELEASING.md.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Release.ps1
