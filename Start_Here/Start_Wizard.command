#  EU SAE Wizard - One-click launcher (macOS / Linux)
#
#  macOS:  double-click this file. Terminal opens and the app starts.
#          Your default web browser opens automatically.
#          Keep the Terminal window open while using the app.
#          Press Ctrl+C, or close the window, to stop the app.
#
#  Linux:  run  bash "Start_Here/Start_Wizard.command"  from a terminal.
#
#  If double-clicking shows 'Apple could not verify...' (macOS 15 and later):
#  open System Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll down, click Open Anyway
#  next to this file, then double-click it again. This is needed once.
#
#  If double-clicking does nothing, the executable permission was lost
#  when the ZIP was extracted. Open Terminal and run this once:
#      chmod +x "/path/to/package/Start_Here/"*.command
#  (Type  chmod +x  then drag the Start_Here folder in, add /*.command)
#  Running this file once with  bash  also repairs the permission.
